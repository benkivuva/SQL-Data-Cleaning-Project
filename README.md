# **SQL-Data-Cleaning-Project**


This project was developed using SQL Server and imported data from an Excel file. The focus of this project was to clean and standardize data using various SQL skills. The following skills were demonstrated:

- Basic SQL queries (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY): retrieving data from a database.
- String functions (LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTRING, REPLACE): manipulating text data in columns.
- Conditional statements (CASE): creating conditional logic to update or filter data.
- Aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT): summarizing data by groups.
- Removing duplicates (DISTINCT): eliminating duplicate rows in a table.
- Deleting columns (ALTER TABLE, DROP COLUMN): removing unnecessary columns.
- Parsing strings (PARSENAME): breaking down text data into separate columns.
- Handling NULL values (ISNULL): handling missing or null values in a table.

The project aims to showcase SQL skills and best practices in cleaning and standardizing data. These skills are important in data analysis and business intelligence, as clean and standardized data leads to more accurate insights and decisions.
